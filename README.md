A dark UI and similarly styled color scheme for making it easier on the eyes. It comes in two flavors.
The first one is dark theme called `dark` and the second one is darker in nature called `hybrid` but easier on the eyes.

## Installation

To activate the theme, open up user preferences file by clicking `Sublime Text menu -> Preferences -> Settings - User`.
There are two different dark themes, `dark` and `hybrid`.

To activate dark theme, put the following in the Preferences file.
```
"theme": "Midnight-dark.sublime-theme",
```

To activate hybrid theme, put the following in the Preferences file.
```
"theme": "Midnight-hybrid.sublime-theme",
```

### Activating color scheme

There are 2 different color schemes that go hand in hand with two different themes provided.
If you are using `dark` theme, please use `dark` color scheme and if you are using `hybrid` theme, its gonna be much better if you use `hybrid` color scheme.

The easiest way to enable a color scheme is by going to
`Sublime Text Menu -> Preferences -> Color Scheme -> Theme - Midnight -> Midnight.(dark|hybrid)`.
